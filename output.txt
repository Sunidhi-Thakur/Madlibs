A kol was once sleeping in the jungle when a kl started running up and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the sleep of kol, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the kl when the kl desperately requested the kol to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The kol laughed at the kl’s confidence and let him go.

One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the kol with them. They tied him up against a tree. The kol was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the kl walked past and noticed the kol in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the kol free. Both of them sped off into the jungle.
